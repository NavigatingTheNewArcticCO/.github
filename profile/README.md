# Navigating the New Arctic Community Office

Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic using convergence research. 
NNA aims to empower new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversify the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhance efforts 
in formal and informal education, and integrate the co-production of knowledge where appropriate.

The Navigating the New Arctic Community Office (NNA-CO) fulfills part of this mission by building awareness, partnerships, opportunities, and resources 
for collaboration and knowledge exchange within, between, and beyond the research projects funded by the NNA Initiative. The NNA-CO increases recognition 
of Indigenous knowledge and data sovereignty; promotes collaborative research design and implementation; and coordinates effective knowledge 
dissemination, education, and outreach. The office builds capacity in early career researchers and provides unique opportunities to inspire and engage 
a wide audience toward a more holistic understanding of the Arctic—its natural environment, built environment, and cultures and communities.
